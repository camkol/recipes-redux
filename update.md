This implementation sets up a simple recipe app using React and Redux with the following key features:

### 1. **Redux Store Configuration:**

The Redux store is configured using `@reduxjs/toolkit` with three slices:

- **`allRecipesSlice`**: Manages all recipes data, including loading, success, and error states.
- **`favoriteRecipesSlice`**: Handles adding/removing favorite recipes.
- **`searchSlice`**: Manages the search term for filtering recipes.

### 2. **Recipe Components:**

There are reusable components for displaying individual recipes and handling user actions:

- **`Recipe`**: Displays a recipe with a name and image.
- **`FavoriteButton`**: A button that allows users to add or remove recipes from their favorites.
- **`Spinner`**: Displays a loading spinner when data is being fetched.

### 3. **Fetching Recipes and Managing State:**

- **Fetching Recipes**: Recipes are loaded asynchronously using the `loadRecipes` thunk. This fetches data from an API (mocked using `msw`) and updates the Redux store.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during the API call, the user sees an error message with a "Try again" button to retry fetching the recipes.
- **Recipe Filtering**: Users can search for specific recipes by name, with search results filtered based on the `searchTerm` stored in the Redux state.

### 4. **Search Functionality:**

The `Search` component allows users to type in a search query, which updates the Redux store. It also features a clear button to reset the search.

### 5. **Favorites Management:**

The app supports adding and removing favorite recipes:

- In the **AllRecipes** component, users can add recipes to their favorites by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button.
- In the **FavoriteRecipes** component, users can remove a recipe from their favorites by clicking the "Remove Favorite" button.

### 6. **Mock Service Worker (MSW):**

`msw` is used to mock API requests during development, simulating data fetching for recipes and users.

### Possible Improvements:

- **Error Handling**: You could add more detailed error messages or log errors for debugging.
- **Styling**: Improve the design and user experience by styling buttons, recipe cards, and error messages.
